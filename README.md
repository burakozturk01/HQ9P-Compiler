# HQ9P-Compiler
HQ9+ is an esoteric programming language designed to achieve smallest possible compiler ever.

It has only 4 functions:
H: Print "hello, world"
Q: Print the program's source code
9: Print the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer"
+: Increment the accumulator

Every character other than H, Q, 9 and + are considered comments.

HQ9P.asm is a MIPS assembly implementation for HQ9+. Text files are text and data sections of asm file.

I used Bin2Img.py from my Python repository to convert this assembly files into images to see them visually and it turned out rather interesting.

tinyestpossible.7z is the smallest I could get the source code be.
